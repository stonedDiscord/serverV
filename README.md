Quote from the VNO Server Guidelines and Rules

Server Rules
Note: Server rules go into 3 categories:
Hard rules: Breaking these results in an instant, undiscutable and unnegotiable removal of your host priviledges, and depending on the  reason, you might also get insta account-banned or VNO-wide IP ban.
Mid rules: Same as hard rules, except those are negotiable to get your host priviledges back.
Sort rules: Those will get you warnings, unlisting and if persisting, removal of your host priviledges (negotiable).

Negotiations happen on skype -> venecity.kalissto



See rules in the page bellow!
And please read the special note regarding content.
HARD RULES
Servers which contains ANY nsfw material OR prejorative material in their provided link, content, name or description will instantly get action taken.
Shock, screamer, pornography, insult, harassment etc.
**Use of any modded server is strictly forbidden, if you want new features for hosting, talk to me instead.**

Seeing these rules as "End User License Agreement" (the stuff you never read when installing anything), makes this server ... illegal i guess.

There is enough reasons to do it anyway, this one is open source and written in a programming language that has a lot of advantages over Delphi, one being multiplatform and small binary sizes.

I created it by reverse engineering the server and client binaries, that means this server is "cleanroom-designed" and perfectly legal in the EU.

Using this server on the official Master/Account Server will most likely get you banned though, so don't use your main account for this.
